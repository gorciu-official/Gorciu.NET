# Gorciu.NET Archive Program

When I created Wavlo - the next generation of Gorciu.NET I promised that every single version of Gorciu.NET will be open-source.

There will be warnings saying you can't see this code, but I added them when I was so naive, so just ignore them and follow the rules of MIT license.
